[Omnipay](https://github.com/thephpleague/omnipay) is a framework agnostic, multi-gateway payment
processing library for PHP 5.3+. This package implements Stripe support for Omnipay.

## Installation

Omnipay is installed via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). To install, simply add it
to your `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "omnipay/stripe": "~2.0"
    }
}
```

And run composer to update your dependencies:

    $ curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    $ php composer.phar update

## Basic Usage

The following gateways are provided by this package:

* Stripe

For general usage instructions, please see the main [Omnipay](https://github.com/thephpleague/omnipay)
repository.

The Stripe integration is fairly straight forward. Essentially you just pass
a `token` field through to Stripe instead of the regular credit card data.

Start by following the standard Stripe JS guide here:
[https://stripe.com/docs/tutorials/forms](https://stripe.com/docs/tutorials/forms)

After that you will have a `stripeToken` field which will be submitted to your server.
Simply pass this through to the gateway as `token`, instead of the usual `card` array:

```php
$token = $_POST['stripeToken'];
$response = $gateway->purchase(['amount' => '10.00', 'currency' => 'USD', 'token' => $token])->send();
```
