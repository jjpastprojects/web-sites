					<p>Unified commenting and forums!<br>
					Comments under articles and threads created in the forum are now linked together creating a cohesive community for users to post content under a single profile. Article threads can be auto populated in the forum and each thread has a unique url. Our commenting and forum platforms can also exist independently on your site.<br>
